=head1 NAME

VCS::SaVeS - VCS::* backend module for Standalone Versioning System(tm)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is simply a namespace placeholder for a VCS::* backend
module for SaVeS(tm). Once both the VCS API and the SaVeS functionality
have matured a bit, this module may actually be implemented to do
something.

See the following manpages for more information about SaVeS:

    svs help
    perldoc saves
    perldoc svs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Inconceivable!

=head1 BUGS & LIMITATIONS

This is brand new alpha stuff. A lot of work was put into it, and the
basics are all seemingly working, but expect (and REPORT) bugs.

SaVeS will almost certainly not run on a non-Unixy system. This may be
fixed if demand is high.

Many svs commands are documented, but not yet implemented. These are
marked 'XXX' in 'svs help commands'.
